Nellie
------

*Away from the circus*

Nellie is intended to be a suite of interconnected APIs and
commandline tools for accessing and manipulating data
in Hadoop clusters from outside of those clusters.

## The Promise

   * Runnable outside of a cluster
   * Minimal runtime dependencies
   * Portability
   * API first

## Status

Currently, Nellie is more like a proof of concept than a real thing.

## TODO

   * Tests
   * Documentation
   * Code cleanup
   * A build script
   * More use cases covered
   * Other Hadoop components (HCat, etc..)
   * Performance improvements
